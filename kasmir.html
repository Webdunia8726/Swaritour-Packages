                <h3>Day 1 : Arrival in Srinagar</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon your arrival in the capital, our representative will greet you with a warm welcome and show you to your houseboat or hotel. After you check-in and freshen up, you can move out to visit your first tourist spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A walk around the scenic Boulevard Road will be your first sightseeing location. The road gives you a view of Dal Lake. Besides that, the majestic Zabarwan Mountain Ranges will also charm you.
                    <br>
                    After the walk, it’s time to relax and take a 2-hour Shikara ride in Dal Lake. Keep your camera ready to click some heart-warming pictures of the mountains. Also, you will notice a beautiful carpet of lotus flowers all over the lake. These flowers enhance the aura of Dal Lake.
                    <br>
                    End your day by making your way back to your houseboat or the hotel for dinner and an overnight stay.

                <h3>Day 2 : Excursion to Sonamarg</h3>
                <p>
                    Begin your morning with a healthy breakfast at the houseboat or hotel and then head out to take a tour of Sonamarg.
                </p>
                <p>                Located 85kms away from Srinagar this valley is the “meadow of gold”. In the valley, peaks of Kolhoi, Amarnath, Sirbal are also located. Let us not forget to mention the drive from Srinagar to Sonamarg. You must try not to sleep; the drive boasts of beautiful roads. You will also spot snow-covered Himalayan peaks throughout the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Sonamarg your first destination is Vishansar Lake. This lake has a unique feature, it freezes in winter and during summer it is surrounded by green grass. In fact, during the summer season, you will spot flocks of sheep that come there for grazing. If you love to trek, you could also enjoy a trekking expedition at the lake.
                </p>
                <p>The next place of wonder is the Zoji La Pass. The road of this pass is covered by a thick layer of snow. A fun fact about this place is that it was once captured by the Pakistan Army but our brave soldiers re-captured it. You will be awe-struck by the beauty of this place.</p>
                <p>If you are an adventure freak then you will love the next destination. We are referring to the White River Rafting at Shutkari Bridge. If you are not a fan of rafting then you can spend time at the Shutkari Bridge and be bewildered by the milky white river flowing below.</p>
                <p>This will bring you to the end of your tiring day. So, head back to your hotel or houseboat for a delicious dinner and a night stay.</p>
